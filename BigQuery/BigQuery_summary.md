## Overview

__Datasets__

There are three major forms of datasets in BigQuery: tables, views, and models.

__Tables__

Table structure comes in two formats: Row-wise and columair formats. Google has its own proprietary columnar sotrage format called _Capacitor_ format. It uses several compressing (encoding) techniques, and supports for nested and repeated fields[^1].
